# LunarLander_Game_Automation
Developed a Multi-Layered Perceptron Neural network

Developed a Multi-Layered Perceptron Neural network using forward and backpropagation
techniques for the Lander game. The Data collected by sample game runs is used to train the
Neural network. Root Mean squared error is used in backpropagation to reduce loss. The trained
model is then used in the game to automatically navigate the lander to the target. No external
library was used and the network structure was created from basic Python code, as only Numpy
and Pandas were allowed.
